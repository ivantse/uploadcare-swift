## Initialization

Upload API requires only a public key:

```swift
let uploadcare = Uploadcare(withPublicKey: "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY")
```

## File upload ##
Uploadcare provides a simple method that will handle file upload. It decides internally the best way to upload a file (to use direct or multipart upload).

```swift
guard let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "Mona_Lisa_23mb", withExtension: "jpg") else { return }
guard let data = try? Data(contentsOf: url) else { return }

let task = uploadcare.uploadFile(data, withName: "some_file.ext", store: .doNotStore) { progress in
    print("progress: \(progress)")
} _: { file, error in
    if let error = error {
        print(error)
        return
    }
    print(file as Any)
}

// You can cancel uploading if needed
task.cancel()

// You can pause uploading
(task as? UploadTaskResumable)?.pause()

// To resume uploading
(task as? UploadTaskResumable)?.resume()
```

## Direct uploads ([API Reference](https://uploadcare.com/api-refs/upload-api/#operation/baseUpload/)) ##

Direct uploads work with background URLSession, so uploading will continue if the app goes to the background state. It support files smaller than 100MB only

```swift
guard let url = URL(string: "https://source.unsplash.com/random"),
      let data = try? Data(contentsOf: url) else { return }
      
let task = uploadcare.uploadAPI.directUpload(files:  ["random_file_name.jpg": data], store: .store) { progress in
    print("upload progress: \(progress * 100)%")
} _: { resultDictionary, error in
    if let error = error {
        print(error)
        return
    }

    guard let files = resultDictionary else { return }
    for file in files {
        print("uploaded file name: \(file.key) | file id: \(file.value)")
    }
}

// You can cancel uploading if needed
task.cancel()
```

## Multipart uploads ([API Reference](https://uploadcare.com/api-refs/upload-api/#operation/multipartFileUploadStart/)) ##

Multipart Uploads are useful when you are dealing with files larger than 100MB or you explicitly want to accelerate uploads. Each Multipart Upload contains 3 steps:
1. Start transaction
2. Upload file chunks concurrently
3. Complete transaction

You can use this upload method and it'll run all 3 steps for you:

```swift
guard let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "Mona_Lisa_23mb", withExtension: "jpg") else { return }
let data = try! Data(contentsOf: url)

let task = uploadcare.uploadAPI.multipartUpload(data, withName: "Mona_Lisa_big.jpg", store: .store) { progress in
    print("progress: \(progress)")
} _: { file, error in
    if let error = error {
        print(error)
        return
    }
    print(file as Any)
}

// You can cancel uploading if needed
task.cancel()

// You can pause uploading
task.pause()

// To resume uploading
task.resume()
```

## Upload files from URLs ([API Reference](https://uploadcare.com/api-refs/upload-api/#operation/fromURLUpload/)) ##

```swift
guard let url = URL(string: "https://source.unsplash.com/random") else { return }

// Set parameters by accessing properties
let task1 = UploadFromURLTask(sourceUrl: url)
task1.checkURLDuplicates = true
task1.saveURLDuplicates = true
task1.store = .store

// Or set parameters using chaining
let task2 = UploadFromURLTask(sourceUrl: url)
    .checkURLDuplicates(true)
    .saveURLDuplicates(true)
    .store(.store)

// Upload
uploadcare.uploadAPI.upload(task: task1) { result, error in
    if let error = error {
        print(error)
        return
    }
    print(result as Any)
    
    // Upload token that you can use to check status
    let token = result?.token
}
```

## Check the status of a file uploaded from URL ([API Reference](https://uploadcare.com/api-refs/upload-api/#operation/fromURLUploadStatus/)) ##

Use a token recieved with Upload files from the URLs method:

```swift
uploadcare.uploadAPI.uploadStatus(forToken: "UPLOAD_TOKEN") { status, error in
    if let error = error {
        print(error)
        return
    }
    print(status as Any)
}
```

## File info ([API Reference](https://uploadcare.com/api-refs/upload-api/#operation/fileUploadInfo/)) ##

```swift
uploadcare.uploadAPI.fileInfo(withFileId: "FILE_UUID") { file, error in
    if let error = error {
        print(error)
        return
    }
    print(file as Any)
}
```

## Create file group ([API Reference](https://uploadcare.com/api-refs/upload-api/#operation/createFilesGroup/)) ##

Uploadcare library provides 2 methods to create a group:

1. Provide files as an array of UploadedFile:

```swift
let files: [UploadedFile] = [file1,file2]
uploadcare.uploadAPI.createFilesGroup(files: files) { response, error in
    if let error = error {
        print(error)
        return
    }
    print(response as Any)
}
```

2. Provide an array of file UUIDs:

```swift
let filesIds: [String] = ["FILE_UUID1", "FILE_UUID2"]
uploadcare.uploadAPI.createFilesGroup(fileIds: filesIds) { response, error in
    if let error = error {
        print(error)
        return
    }
    print(response as Any)
}
```

## Files group info ([API Reference](https://uploadcare.com/api-refs/upload-api/#operation/filesGroupInfo/)) ##

```swift
uploadcare.uploadAPI.filesGroupInfo(groupId: "FILES_GROUP_ID") { group, error in
    if let error = error {
        print(error)
        return
    }
    print(group as Any)
}
```

## Secure uploads ([API Reference](https://uploadcare.com/docs/api_reference/upload/signed_uploads/)) ##

Signing requests works by default if a Secret key is provided during SDK initialization. SDK generates a signature internally, and this signature stays valid for 30 minutes. New signatures are generated automatically when older ones expire.

Note that Signed Uploads should be enabled in the projectâ€™s settings in your [Uploadcare dashboard](https://uploadcare.com/dashboard/).
